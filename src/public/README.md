# Public components
ui-service-interaction is to provide both settings configuration as well as a library of widgets to implement any given functionality into other frontend apps.

## Usage
For components with translated components, such as NumberGeneratorButton, you may need to ensure that `ui-service-interaction` is present in the `stripesDeps` portion of your module's package.json.
