# ui-service-interaction

FOLIO UI Module for service-interaction

This contains both some UI elements which will manifest as a FOLIO standard app, as well as components for interactions, which can be imported as a standard component:

```import { someComponent } from '@folio/service-interaction'```

These components can be found [here](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-service-interaction/tree/master/src/public).
